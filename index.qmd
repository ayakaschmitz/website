::: {#ppc}
I am a recent graduate of University of Colorado, Denver where I majored in biology and minored in mathematics. My education has equipped me with excellent problem-solving, communication, and critical thinking skills. I am also proficient in querying languages such as SQL and programming languages such as Python and R. I am eager to apply these technical skills to make data-driven decisions. I am specifically interested in solving problems related to the healthcare and the environmental field.
